# Finally, Cybersecurity That Makes Sense for Small Business

**You never planned to become a cybersecurity expert.** You just wanted to run your business without worrying about ransomware, data breaches, or losing government contracts to compliance requirements.

**What if you could skip the learning curve?**

Join other smart business owners who share what actually works. Get proven configurations, member-tested templates, and real-world processes from businesses just like yours—then customize them for your specific needs.

**Stop starting from scratch. Start with what works.**

---

### ✅ **Member-shared solutions** tested in real businesses

### ✅ **Community-built templates** for policies, compliance, and response plans

### ✅ **Peer-to-peer knowledge** at small business prices

### ✅ **Plain English guidance** from business owners who've been there

---

**Important:** SOISA materials are shared by fellow business owners based on their experience. While battle-tested in real businesses, you'll need to adapt configurations and templates to fit your specific environment, compliance requirements, and business needs. Members are expected to share their improvements back to the community.

## Why Smart Business Owners Join SOISA

**Because trial-and-error is expensive.** And time-consuming. And frustrating.

Smart business owners recognize that cybersecurity isn't optional anymore—but they also know they don't need to figure it out alone.

### What You Get When You Join

**Skip the Research Phase**  
Instead of spending weeks comparing backup solutions, use the exact setup that's protecting 200+ other businesses. Complete with step-by-step setup guides written by the members who implemented them.

**Learn from Real Wins (and Failures)**  
When a member discovers that a specific firewall rule breaks their VoIP system, everyone benefits from that knowledge. No need for you to make the same expensive mistake.

**Templates That Actually Fit**  
Forget those generic policy templates written by lawyers for Fortune 500 companies. Our policies are created by 15-employee manufacturers, 8-person consulting firms, and 25-employee distributors — businesses like yours.

**Get Unstuck Fast**  
Hit a roadblock implementing email security? Post your question and get answers from members who've solved the same problem in similar environments.

**Stop Overpaying for Basic Protection**  
Members routinely save $15,000-$30,000 per year by using proven open-source and built-in solutions instead of expensive vendor packages designed for enterprises.

### The Community Advantage

**This isn't a course or consulting service.** It's a working group of business owners who share what's actually working in their companies — and expect you to do the same when you find improvements.

**Recent member contributions:**

- Updated Microsoft 365 security configuration that closes 3 new vulnerability gaps
- Policy template for handling CMMC Level 1 requirements (saves $8,000 in consultant fees)
- Backup testing checklist that caught failures in 12 member companies before they became disasters

### Who Thrives in SOISA

**✅ Business owners who prefer learning from peers over paying consultants**  
**✅ Companies that need practical solutions, not theoretical frameworks**  
**✅ Leaders willing to share their wins to help other small businesses**  
**✅ Organizations that value community knowledge over vendor sales pitches**


**Ready to stop figuring this out alone?** Join business owners who've already done the hard work—and are willing to share what they learned.

**The community that gets it is waiting for you.**
